ExpandSelectionAbove
====================

This is a Sublime plugin allows you to select the line similar to `ctrl+L` but will select the line above when repeating. This plugin is not added to Package Manager so if you find this useful, please file an enhancement request or send me an email and I will go about adding it. For now, if you would like to install, navigate to the Package directory and use

```
git clone https://github.com/dsullivan7/ExpandSelectionAbove.git
``` 

And add the following to your Keybindings file:

```
{ "keys": ["ctrl+shift+l"], "command": "select_above" }
```
